 Database (Supabase)

Tables:

users – Customer, store, delivery, and admin accounts

stores – Restaurant data (name, logo, contact info)

menus – Menu items with price & Cloudinary image URLs

orders – Orders with status (pending, accepted, delivered)

order_items – Items inside each order

delivery – Delivery assignments & location updates

notifications – Order & delivery notifications

 RLS Policies: Each role (customer, store, delivery, admin) should only see their own data.

 Storage (Cloudinary)

Used for:

Menu item images

Store logos

Proof-of-delivery photos

Example:
import cloudinary.uploader

upload_result = cloudinary.uploader.upload(
    "food.jpg",
    folder="smarteats/menus"
)
print(upload_result["secure_url"])
