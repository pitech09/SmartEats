    <h2 style="color:#25D366;">About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Khauhelo Makara</strong>, the founder of <strong>SmartEats</strong>, a digital food ordering and delivery platform serving Maputsoe, Leribe, and Roma, Maseru. My goal is simple: make food delivery easy, fast, and reliable for everyone on campus.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#25D366;">My Journey</h3>
    <p>I started my BSc in Computer Science at the National University of Lesotho in 2021. Along the way, I realized how challenging it was for students and locals to access food from nearby restaurants conveniently. That inspired me to create SmartEats—a platform connecting people with their favorite meals while supporting local businesses.</p>

    <h3 style="color:#25D366;">What I Do</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Design and maintain the SmartEats web and mobile applications.</li>
        <li>Work closely with local restaurants to make their menus accessible online.</li>
        <li>Manage delivery operations and ensure orders reach customers on time.</li>
        <li>Analyze user behavior and improve app features based on real feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:#25D366;">Vision & Values</h3>
    <p>SmartEats is more than just an app—it’s a community. I believe in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Seamless ordering and delivery experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Support:</strong> Helping local restaurants grow by reaching more customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Using technology to solve real problems in everyday life.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Building a platform where users feel confident ordering and interacting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color:#25D366;">A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>Outside of SmartEats, I enjoy cycling across Leribe, exploring tech innovations, and experimenting with new ideas for apps and services. I’m constantly learning and improving, and I’m always open to feedback from users and partners to make SmartEats better.</p>
